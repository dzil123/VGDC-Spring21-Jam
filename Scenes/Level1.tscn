How can I reference the object variable in _on_Tween_tween_completed(object, key) if what is being generated is the I.D. and object type?

For example; say I wanted something to happen in the _on_Tween_tween_completed(object, key) only if one a specific tween finishes, out of multiple. Something like this doesn't seem to work:", "object in the signal parameters is a reference to the object the tween is operating on.

I can't see your tween setup, but you may be accessing the wrong node. Try putting print(object.name) there to check.

I'm so sorry, I never got an alert to your replying.

I retested it and the object reference works exactly as expected, I was wrong in my initial question. Thank you for the quick reply you gave me though!
